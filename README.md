## Markdown Filters ##

I use these, you can use them too!

NOTE! This library is going through a *lot* of changes right now. Use directly at your peril! Feel free to take what you need from the source though, if you feel there may be something useful there.

### Link Reffing ###

If you'd don't want your links inline and would prefer to have them at the bottom of the document, then you can use this:
    
    The UtterFAIL website [UtterFAIL!](http://utterfail.info) is good. My blog [My blog](http://iainbarnett.me.uk) is also good.

and it will produce this:

    The UtterFAIL website[&#8304;](#0 "Jump to reference") is good. My blog[&sup1;](#1 "Jump to reference") is also good.
    <a name="0"></a>&#91;0&#93; [http://utterfail.info](http://utterfail.info "http://utterfail.info") UtterFAIL!
    
    
    <a name="1"></a>&#91;1&#93; [http://iainbarnett.me.uk](http://iainbarnett.me.uk "http://iainbarnett.me.uk") My blog
